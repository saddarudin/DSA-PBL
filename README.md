# DSA-PBL
Hi, this is my 3rd semester project a problem based learning (PBL) 
These problems has been taken from Kaggle website. 
There may be some complexity in code as this is completely 
solved by me you can suggest any issue by arising an issue
In this repository I have used the concepts of DSA to handle the data
The first PBL is based on top 100 universities of Pakistan
The second PBL is based on the Crashes of a city from 2010 to 2018 
The third PBL is based on the EarthQuacks that occurred in different countries
