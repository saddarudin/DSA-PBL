# DSA-PBL
Hi, this is my third semester project a problem based learning (PBL) 
These problems have been taken from Kaggle website. 
There may be some complexities in code as this is completely 
solved by me you can suggest any issue by raising an issue.
In this repository I've used the concepts of DSA to handle the data.
The first PBL is based on top 100 universities of Pakistan.
The second PBL is based on the Crashes of a city from 2010 to 2018. 
The third PBL is based on the EarthQuacks that occurred in different countries.
